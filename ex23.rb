# Reading code on the internet

# 1. Go to bitbucket, github, gitorious search ruby
# 2. Pick random project and click on it
# 3. Click on the source, find .rb file
# 4. Start from top to bottom, read the code, take a note!
# 5. If found any symbol or strage function interest, write them to research later

# Other resources:
# sourceforge
# launchpad
 
# The goals are:
# 1. Finding ruby source code for things you need
# 2. Reading through the code and looking for files
# 3. Trying to understand code you find
